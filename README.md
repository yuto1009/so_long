# so_long
This is a project at 42 programming school. It's the first graphical project I've done.
The so_long consists of a top-down game, which we code from scratch using the MiniLibx graphical library. 
It involves a series of validations from the map that is passed as argument, checks to prevent memoy leaks,
the game engineering, managing windows, events, sprites and maps.

## Requirements
In order to play the game, 
you need to install [MiniLibx](https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux) feature or use one of machines at 42.

To play, first compile the project with make:
```
make
```
Run ./so_long maps/map1.ber
```
./so_long maps/map1.ber
```
